# Smart Eventing (Pebble App)

An app for the Pebble watch for equestrian eventing.

Coursewalk with the app to measure exact distances using GPS, and note the minute-markers.

While on horseback going cross-country, the app will alert you to minute markers and indicate whether you should speed up or slow down by changing colour from green (speed up) to red (slow down).
